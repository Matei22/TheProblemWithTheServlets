# TheProplemWithTheServlets
I installed the Oracle IDE for EE with jdk 17, I lunched the Eclipse IDE and then I used the TomCat 8.5 at first, with the version 2.5 for the Dynamic WEB module version, but I faced some problems. So I tried to build a WEB project with TomCat 10, because it was the latest version and with the version 5.0 for the Dynamic WEB module version, but even that I specifically put the web version to be 5.0, in the end the version was the same, 2.5 in the ****_web.xml_**** file. It would be perfect if you could help me with the both version of TomCat for a better understanding of the Servlets. Thank you very much and I apologieze for the inconvenience.
